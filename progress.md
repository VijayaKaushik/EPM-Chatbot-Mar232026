### [2026-03-23 14:30 EST] Created vesting_agent sub-agent

**What changed**
- Created `app/agent/manager/sub_agent/vesting_agent/__init__.py` — empty init for package
- Created `app/agent/manager/sub_agent/vesting_agent/tool.py` — two tools: `get_vesting_dates` (returns hardcoded quarterly dates) and `get_vesting_details` (returns 3 sample participant records, manages token state)
- Created `app/agent/manager/sub_agent/vesting_agent/agent.py` — `vesting_agent` LlmAgent (gemini-2.0-flash) with both tools + SkillToolset; exports `root_agent = vesting_agent` for adk web
- Created `app/agent/manager/sub_agent/vesting_agent/skills/welcome_intent/SKILL.md` — 5-stage greet/classify/route skill adapted for vesting-only capabilities
- Created `app/agent/manager/sub_agent/vesting_agent/skills/vesting_schedule/SKILL.md` — 2-stage skill: get dates → get details with tool signatures, return shapes, and state side effects documented

**Logic & data flow**
- `get_vesting_dates(count)` returns a slice of 4 hardcoded quarterly dates (2026)
- `get_vesting_details(vesting_date, tool_context)` generates a UUID-based `token_id`, appends `(vesting_date, token_id)` to `tool_context.state["token_vesting_list"]`, and returns 3 hardcoded participant records with varied departments (Finance, Engineering, Sales), grant types (RSU, PSU, Stock Option), and statuses (Completed, Completed, Pending)
- Skills loaded via `load_skill_from_dir()` → bundled into `SkillToolset` → passed to LlmAgent `tools=[]`
- Agent instruction explicitly tells LLM to never expose `token_id` to users

**Assumptions**
- Used `gemini-2.0-flash` as specified in the task, not `gemini-2.5-flash` used by releasemanagement_agent
- Participant data is fully hardcoded (no Faker/random generation) — 3 records with realistic but static values
- `token_vesting_list` state key follows the same convention as releasemanagement_agent for future compatibility
- Did not wire vesting_agent into manager_agent's sub_agents list — task scope was limited to creating the agent only

**Context for future contributors**
- This agent is standalone and can be tested via `adk web app/agent/manager/sub_agent/vesting_agent` since `root_agent` is defined in agent.py
- To integrate into the main app, add `from app.agent.manager.sub_agent.vesting_agent.agent import vesting_agent` to `app/agent/manager/agent.py` and include it in `manager_agent`'s `sub_agents=[]` list
- The `token_vesting_list` state is shared session state — if both releasemanagement_agent and vesting_agent run in the same session, their tokens will coexist in the same list
